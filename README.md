Sokoban is a puzzle game in which the player controls a character who pushes boxes around a maze. The goal of the game is to push all the boxes onto their designated spots on the map. As the player progresses through the game, the levels become more challenging and complex, requiring more strategy to complete. The name "Sokoban" is of Japanese origin and translates to "warehouse keeper". The game has been around since the 1980s and has been ported to many different platforms and operating systems.
